ðŸ“Œ Whatâ€™s Next on the Agenda?

Here are your most strategic next steps:
1. Model Explainability (recommended next)

Knowing why your model predicts failure builds trust and gives you insight.

Options:

    Plot feature importances (already done)

    Use SHAP values to show per-row decision logic

2. Streamlit Interface (strong portfolio move)

Create a simple UI where users can:

    Upload raw sensor data

    View predicted labels and risk levels

    Filter or sort by danger level

No cost. Just streamlit run app.py.
3. Evaluate Generalization with Real Test Set

Use test_FD001.txt + RUL_FD001.txt to simulate real-world inference:

    Predict from raw data

    Compare against true remaining useful life

This mimics how your system would behave live.
4. Experiment with Model Variants

Try:

    XGBoost or LightGBM

    Logistic Regression for comparison

    Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)

5. Create a Reporting Layer

Generate a summary of:

    Engines at high risk

    Total failure rate detected

    Average predicted risk by engine

Could be saved to CSV, plotted, or output in Streamlit.
